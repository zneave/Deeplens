# DeepLens: Interactive Visualization of Neural Network Internals

DeepLens is an interactive dashboard designed to help machine learning engineers and researchers explore the internal activations of deep neural networks. Built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [Dash Bootstrap Components](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/), DeepLens uses a pretrained ResNet18 model from PyTorch to visualize layer outputs in both single-channel and grid views. The dashboard displays activation maps as heatmaps, and provides statistical summaries for each channel.

## Features

- **Model Activations Visualization:** Explore the internal activations of a pretrained ResNet18 model using PyTorch.
- **Dynamic Controls:**  
  - **Layer Selection:** Choose from multiple layers whose activations are hooked into.
  - **View Mode Toggle:** Switch between a "Single" view (one channel or average) and a "Grid" view (all channels).
  - **Channel Slider:** Select a specific channel (or average) for detailed inspection.
- **Image Upload:** Upload your own image for custom activations.
- **Activation Statistics:** See per-channel statistics such as mean, standard deviation, min, and max.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with Dash and Bootstrap, the layout works across devices.
- **Documentation and Help:** Built-in documentation page and detailed "Learn More" modal for guidance.
